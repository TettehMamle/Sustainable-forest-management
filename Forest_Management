There are many ways in which technology can aid forest management in Africa. One of the most important ways is through the use of geospatial technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographical Information System (GIS), and remote sensing. These technologies can help forest managers to map and monitor forest resources, identify areas of deforestation and degradation, and plan and implement forest restoration and conservation programs12.

Other technologies that can be used for forest management in Africa include forest modeling technologies, molecular markers, Gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)1. These technologies can help to improve forest inventory, assess forest health, and monitor forest carbon stocks.

In addition, there are several innovative technologies that are being developed to help with forest management in Africa.
